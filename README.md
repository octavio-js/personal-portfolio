# Personal Portfolio Website
## Description
This is my portfolio website. It features a short description of myself, along with some projects and my skills. I am currently still learning about web development, so this page may change as I continue learning new concepts and building better projects.
## Features
Responsive design and interactive content.
## Purpose
Having a Personal Portfolio is a must for any developer. Here, I can showcase some of the projects that I am most proud of and can easily add more as I learn and progress. Also, I can also easily showcase skills that I acumulate as I continue learning.

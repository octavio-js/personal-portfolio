          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hey! I'm Octavio. I really enjoy building websites and writing code. It's something I've loved doing for a long time, and I'm always excited to learn new things and improve my skills. Whether it's trying out a new programming language or working on a fun project, coding always keeps me interested.</p>
          <p>I speak English, Romanian, and Spanish, which helps me connect with people from different places. In my free time, I like playing chess, reading books, and of course, I love gaming.</p>
          <p>One more thing about me: I really love cats! They're funny, curious, and always find a way to make me smile.</p>

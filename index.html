          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hey! I'm Octavio. I really enjoy building websites and writing code. It's something I've loved doing for a long time, and I'm always excited to learn new things and improve my skills. Whether it's trying out a new programming language or working on a fun project, coding always keeps me interested.</p>
          <p>I speak English, Romanian, and Spanish, which helps me connect with people from different places. In my free time, I like playing chess, reading books, and of course, I love gaming.</p>
          <p>One more thing about me: I really love cats! They're funny, curious, and always find a way to make me smile.</p>

            <h4>Project Info</h4>
            <p>ChatterBox is a C++ Console App. It has a Sign up/Login system and a messaging system that lets you message other users. It also has a storage system where it stores every account and messages that were sent, so even if you close the app after signing up, you can login back into your account, continue talking to your friends and still see the messages you sent and received.</p>
            <img src="./resources/media/sign-in-chatterbox.png" class="chatterbox-image" alt="Creating a new account in ChatterBox">
            <p>ChatterBox ensures you have a valid username, email and password. After the account is created, the app stores the account information into the storage and you can close the app and then login into that same account!</p>
            <img src="./resources/media/login-chatterbox.png" class="chatterbox-image" alt="Login in ChatterBox">
            <p>When you login, the app makes sure that the name, email and password are correct. After you succesfully log in, the app loads the messages you sent and the messages you received.</p>
            <img src="./resources/media/send-message-chatterbox.png" class="chatterbox-image" alt="Send a message with ChatterBox">
            <p>When you send a message, the app checks if the users exists. If it does, you can send a message. After that, you can see the messages you sent along with a time stamp and to who that message was sent.</p>
            <img src="./resources/media/receive-message-chatterbox.png" class="chatterbox-image" alt="Receive a message ChatterBox">
            <p>You can also check the messages you received along with a time stamp and who sent you that message.</p>
